# NetworkTables-HID

A sketchy work-in-progress way to use HID devices through [NetworkTables](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/networktables/networktables-intro.html), a publish-subscribe network protocol used in FRC. This was essentially only made to control our robot with a DDR dance pad for fun, but could probably be useful for other demos and fun projects. I'll write a Java handler implementation soon.
